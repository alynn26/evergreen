== Removal of OpenILS::Utils::ISBN ==

Evergreen used to include a perl module called OpenILS::Utils::ISBN.
This module provided a single subroutine, `isbn_upconvert`, which
wrapped some behavior from the Business::ISBN module.  The module
is no longer used in Evergreen code.  Any custom code that used it
should be migrated to use Business::ISBN directly.
